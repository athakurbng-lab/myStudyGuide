### 1. 🎧 Audio Study Engine
Turn boring PDFs into engaging audio podcasts.

### 2. 📝 Quiz Generator Hub

### 3. 🧠 Smart Quiz Engine
A powerful testing interface designed for serious students.
*   **Partial Submissions**: Don't have time for the full test? Answer a few questions, save, and "Resume" later exactly where you left off.
*   **Question Locking**: To ensure integrity, questions you've already submitted in a partial attempt are locked in future sessions.
*   **Review Mode**: Double-tap any past attempt in your History to see exactly which questions you got right or wrong.

### 4. 📈 AI Tutor & Analysis
Understand your weak spots.
